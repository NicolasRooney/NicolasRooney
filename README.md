Hello!  I'm currently studying in two separate disciplines to achieve a dual-degree in quantitative economics and computation applied mathematics.  As an undergraduate, I have sought out the appreciation of my skills by surrounding myself in the culture of mathematics and have since let my education be driven by a deep passion for the world of finance and mathematical analysis alike.
If you'd like to know a little bit more about me, come check out my [Obsidian website](https://publish.obsidian.md/random-walks), as most of what is posted on GitHub is complementary to this website.
